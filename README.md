## Microsoft RulesEngine Learning Project
# Overview
This project is a learning endeavor aimed at exploring the capabilities of Microsoft RulesEngine. The RulesEngine library provides a powerful framework for defining and executing business rules in .NET applications. Through this project, we aim to understand the core concepts of rule-based programming, explore various features of RulesEngine, and gain practical experience by working on real-world scenarios.

# Features
-  Rule Definition: Define rules using lambda expressions, strings, or custom expressions.
-  Rule Execution: Execute rules dynamically in different contexts to validate data, enforce policies, or automate decisions.
-  Rule Sets: Organize rules into sets or workflows to manage complex logic more effectively.
-  Error Handling: Handle rule evaluation errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to users.
-  Integration: Integrate RulesEngine seamlessly with existing .NET applications and frameworks.
-  Scalability: Scale rule execution to handle large datasets and high-throughput scenarios with ease.
